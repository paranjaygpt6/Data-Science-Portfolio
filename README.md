# Data-Science-Portfolio
###### This is a public portfolio containing all the Data Science projects and ML done by me for academic and self learning purposes. Most of the data used is taken from open source web pages

###### I have split the projects done by me into various subcategories-

## Exploratory Data Analysis Projects
* [Titanic dataset Exploratory Data Analysis and Survival Prediction](https://github.com/paranjaygpt6/Data-Science-Portfolio/blob/master/Titanic%20EDA%20project/Titanic%20exploratory%20analysis%20and%20survival%20prediction.ipynb) - This project makes use of the famous titanic dataset from kaggle. Imported and analyzed the data in an ipython notebook.

* Using [Logistic Regression for Heart Disease Prediction](https://github.com/paranjaygpt6/Data-Science-Portfolio/blob/master/LR%20Heart%20Disease%20Prediction%20EDA%20project/LR_HeartDisease_prediction.ipynb) - This project makes use of a kaggle dataset to predict the chances of a person having/getting a heart disease based on several factors about his/her life.

* [911 Calls EDA Project](https://github.com/paranjaygpt6/Data-Science-Portfolio/blob/master/911%20Calls%20EDA%20project/911%20exploratory%20analysis.ipynb) - Exploratory Data Analysis of the 911 calls dataset from kaggle. A great data set which forces us to use data manipulatrions for better extraction of insights.

Libraries Used: Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Seaborn and Plotly

## General concept based projects
* [Data Merging](https://github.com/paranjaygpt6/Data-Science-Portfolio/blob/master/Conceptual%20Projects/Merging_Datasets_eda.ipynb) - A simple project to understand the concept of Data Merging using Pandas

* [Web Scraping HTML Tables - 4 Ways](https://github.com/paranjaygpt6/Data-Science-Portfolio/blob/master/Conceptual%20Projects/Webscraping%20HTML%20tables.ipynb) - In this project I have explored the different ways in which we can web scrape a HTML table. We have used Pandas, lxml, Scrapy and BeautifulSoup to webscrape the same table.

## Machine Learning Projects
* [Supervised Learning - K Nearest Neighbours](https://github.com/paranjaygpt6/Data-Science-Portfolio/blob/master/KNN%20Social%20Media%20Ads/Social%20Network%20Ads%20K%20Means%20Clustering.ipynb) - This project makes use of the K-NN on a customer database that bought an SUV based on online advertisements
